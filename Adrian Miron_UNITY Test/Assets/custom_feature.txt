"Glass of Water Powerup" feature will work in that way:
 - Human or AI player touches the glass of water powerup
 - From the center of the touched powerup will fill with white color at a big radius
 - All previously existed painted pixels will be erased and this area will be free to be painted

Why will "Glass of Water" feature work?

Emotional Engagement: Players always love risk/reward. They will come back time and time again to try to use the glass to their advantage, despite the risk of losing.
Competitive Element: This mechanic forces players to interact not only with the powerup, but also with each other, trying to use the "glass of water" as a weapon. 

Players will have to decide whether to take the risk of picking up the glass when a drop could wipe off their paint, too. This creates a dilemma that always keeps players engaged.
